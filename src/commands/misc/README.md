# Miscelaneous Commands

These are commands to control oaf or otherwise engage with Discord itself.

### /remind

When invoked, this command generates a reminder that can be used to remind yourself to do things, either in-game or out-of-game. The command has a "when" option, in which you'll put how long in the future you want the reminder to be (formatted as "1d2h" or "3h" or "30m"). If you would like `oaf` to ping you ten minutes after rollover, you can also use `rollover` as the "when" parameter. As seen in the screenshot, you can (and should) put a specific message in the reminder outlining what it is you want to be reminded of.

### /oops

Purges the last message `oaf` sent in the current channel. Useful if you typo'd something and want to hide the evidence.

### /purge

Purges the last X messages `oaf` sent in the current channel. Useful if you typo'd your existence as a human being and would like to hide the evidence more thoroughly.

## Fun Commands

These are mostly just little fun things, or mildly helpful shorthand when you don't want to do the mental math. Screenshots not included, as these are all relatively simplistic.

- **/orb** -- Provides a randomized magic 8-ball prediction to an asked question.
- **/prswelcome** -- Primarily for LASS devs. Generates a link for a given repository that shows all PRs & Issues that have been assigned to you in that repository.
- **/roll** -- Rolls dice. Basically every bot can do this. Syntax is "4d7" where the first number is the number of dice and the second is the number of sides of the dice.
