# oaf

## A Discord Bot for the Ascension Speed Society

This is a bot built specifically for the Ascension Speed Society, a Discord server based around speedrunning in the Kingdom of Loathing. It has a truly startling number of features.

To invoke `oaf`, you use "slash commands". To see `oaf` options in the Discord window, all you have to do is type a single forward slash (`/`); when you do, a long list of possible commands is spawned, like so:

This should (in theory) make `oaf` relatively self-documenting, as each command has its own string describing the action. For the purposes of thorough documentation, as many commands as possible are documented in their respective category directories within `/src/commands`.

This bot was originally built by [Alistair Crook](https://github.com/Phillammon), and is currently maintained by `loathers`. We are all deeply grateful for the yeoman's work Alistair did in setting `oaf` (and hopping back in to upgrade it liberally.)
